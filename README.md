# RAG Model for QA Bot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot tailored for business use cases. The model leverages Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval, LangChain for RAG architecture, and Hugging Face models for embedding and question answering.

## Features

### 1. Pinecone Integration
- Initializes and manages a Pinecone index for efficient document storage and retrieval.
- Prepares text data for embedding using a transformation pipeline.
- Utilizes Hugging Face embeddings to represent documents for semantic similarity calculations.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Implements RAG using LangChain's `RetrievalQA`, integrating document retrieval with question answering.
- Dynamically determines whether to retrieve documents or directly answer based on query classification.

### 3. Question Answering
- Employs a DistilBERT-based model for direct question answering when document retrieval is unnecessary.
- Fine-tunes QA pipeline for high accuracy and relevance in responses.

## Optimizing RAG

RAG models combine retrieval and generation to provide accurate and context-rich answers. Optimization enhances their accuracy, speed, and user experience.

### Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Query Optimization
- **Relevance Filtering**: Implements a query classifier to identify whether retrieval is necessary. Refines queries using TF-IDF or semantic similarity.
- **Dynamic Query Expansion**: Expands user queries with synonyms or related terms using NLP techniques like WordNet or transformer-based models. Improves recall and relevance.
- **Fine-tuning the Retriever**: Uses labeled datasets to fine-tune embedding models for better query-document relevance.

#### 2. Model Efficiency and Scalability
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Distills larger models (e.g., `flan-t5-large`) into smaller ones (e.g., `flan-t5-small`) to reduce latency.
- **Batch Processing for Retrieval**: Optimizes parallel processing for embedding and retrieval using libraries like Dask.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)**: Utilizes Pinecone's ANN algorithms to enhance retrieval speed without compromising accuracy.

## Dataset Preparation for Fine-Tuning

High-quality datasets are critical for fine-tuning AI models to ensure accuracy and robustness.

### Techniques for Dataset Preparation
- **Data Collection**: Sources include FAQs, transaction logs, and customer queries. Ensures diversity and balance across categories.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Removes duplicates and noise, standardizes formats (e.g., dates, currency).
- **Text Annotation and Labeling**: Labels queries as "retrieval-based" or "direct answer." Utilizes crowdsourcing or internal QA teams.
- **Data Augmentation**: Generates paraphrased queries using tools like T5 or back-translation. Adds synthetic samples for better generalization.
- **Validation Splits**: Divides data into training, validation, and test sets to monitor performance and avoid overfitting.

### Preferred Approach
**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning** is recommended for its balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Techniques like LoRA enable adapting large pre-trained models with minimal resource overhead.
